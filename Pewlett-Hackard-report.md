# Title: Employee Database Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to examine the employee database of Pewlett-Hackard to identify potential retirements and mentorship opportunities. By analyzing the data, we aim to understand the current state of the workforce, identify employees who are eligible for retirement, and determine potential candidates for the mentorship program.

## Results:

### Retirement Titles:

We created a table, "retirement_titles," to hold the titles of employees who are eligible for retirement.
By using the DISTINCT ON statement, we obtained the most recent title of each retiring employee.
The table "retirement_titles" provides a comprehensive view of all retiring employees along with their most recent job titles.
Retiring Titles Count:

We generated a table, "retiring_titles," which displays the count of employees by their most recent job titles who are about to retire.
The table is sorted in descending order based on the number of employees per title.
The "retiring_titles" table allows management to understand the distribution of retiring employees across different job titles.

## Summary:


### Retirement Eligibility:

A significant number of employees are eligible for retirement, and this could lead to a considerable loss of experience and knowledge.

### Skill Gap and Mentorship Opportunities:

With a large portion of the workforce nearing retirement, there is a potential skill gap that could impact company operations.
It is essential to address the skill gap by implementing a robust mentorship program to transfer knowledge from experienced employees to younger staff.


### Unique Titles of Current Employees:

We created a table, "unique_titles," which contains the most recent titles of all current employees who are not retiring.
The "unique_titles" table helps identify employees who are actively contributing to the company's operations and are not retiring soon.

### Mentorship Eligibility:

We generated a table, "mentorship_eligibility," to identify current employees eligible for the mentorship program.
These employees were born between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1965, and are currently employed.
The "mentorship_eligibility" table provides a list of potential candidates for the mentorship program to groom future leaders.
In conclusion, Pewlett-Hackard faces a significant challenge with a large number of employees eligible for retirement.
