# Analysis
As part of the ongoing efforts to prepare for the "silver tsunami," Bobby, a skilled SQL analyst, and I have been given two assignments. The first involves determining the number of retiring employees per job. The second requires identifying the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. In order to manage the upcoming wave of retirements, we have conducted an analysis using SQL queries and have summarized our findings in this report.

## The Number of Retiring Employees by Titl
The first task was to create a Retirement Titles table that holds all titles of employees born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955. We achieved this by using the DISTINCT ON statement to identify the most recent title for each employee. The process involved joining the Employees and Titles tables based on primary keys, filtering data based on birth dates, and ordering by employee number. The resulting table, named "retirement_titles," provides a comprehensive view of the titles of retiring employees. Then we refined the data to remove duplicates and retain only the most recent title for each employee, resulting in the "unique_titles" table. Finally, we generated the "retiring_titles" table that showcases the count of retirement-age employees by their most recent job titles, aiding in resource planning for the future.

## The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program:
To address the need for mentorship programs, we identified current employees eligible for mentorship based on their birth dates and employment status. Our SQL queries retrieved relevant information from the Employees, Department Employee, and Titles tables. We focused on employees born between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1965, who are currently employed. This information was organized and added to the "mentorship_eligibility" table.

# Summary:
As the "silver tsunami" approaches, the analysis has provided insights into the organization's workforce dynamics. 
The four major points from the analysis are as follows:

A number of employees are approaching retirement age, necessitating effective resource planning for succession.
The Retirement Titles table highlights the distribution of retirement-age employees across various job titles, aiding in resource allocation.
The Mentorship Eligibility table identifies potential mentors among current employees born in 1965, helping bridge knowledge gaps.
The analysis illustrates the importance of preparing for the knowledge transfer and succession planning to ensure a smooth transition.

## Answers:
The impending "silver tsunami" will require a considerable number of roles to be filled to maintain operational efficiency and knowledge continuity.
While there are eligible retirement-ready employees, it's important that additional mentorship initiatives and resources are required to ensure an effective knowledge transfer and skills development.

### Additional:
To gain further insights into the upcoming "silver tsunami," two additional queries or tables could be considered:

### Skills Gap Analysis:
 Creating a table that identifies specific skills associated with retiring employees' titles and comparing these skills with those possessed by current employees. This can help pinpoint areas where skill gaps may arise.

### Succession Planning:
 Developing a matrix that combines retirement-age employees, their titles, and potential mentorship matches. This matrix can guide the organization in identifying suitable mentors for each retiring employee, facilitating smoother transitions.

By analyzing these aspects, Pewlett Hackard can proactively address challenges posed by the imminent wave of retirements and foster a knowledge-sharing environment.

Through SQL analysis and interpretation, this report aims to assist Bobby's manager in understanding and preparing for the organization's evolving workforce. As the "silver tsunami" approaches, proactive measures based on these insights will be crucial for ensuring Pewlett Hackard's continued success.
